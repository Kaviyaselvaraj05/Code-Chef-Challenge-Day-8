01)Time Complexity:
A sorting algorithm 
𝐴
A is said to have more time complexity than a sorting algorithm 
𝐵
B if it uses more number of comparisons for sorting the same array than algorithm 
𝐵
B.

Given that algorithm 
𝐴
A uses 
𝑋
X comparisons to sort an array and algorithm 
𝐵
B uses 
𝑌
Y comparisons to sort the same array, find whether algorithm 
𝐴
A has more time complexity.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
𝑇
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers 
𝑋
X and 
𝑌
Y — the number of comparisons used by algorithms 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B to sort the array respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if the algorithm 
𝐴
A has more time complexity than 
𝐵
B and NO otherwise.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).
